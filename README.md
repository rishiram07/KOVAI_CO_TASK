# KOVAI_CO_TASK_Public Transport Analysis and Forecasting
This repository contains an analysis and forecasting project for public transport passenger journeys. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, seasonal patterns, and variability in passenger data, along with clustering using K-Means to identify demand profiles. It also features forecasting of passenger counts for key service types (e.g., Local Route, Light Rail) using ARIMA models, with visualizations and metrics to evaluate the results.
